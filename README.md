# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is a Django REST Framework application with integrated WebSocket communication using Channels. It allows users to communicate via chat, send GIFs (after purchase), and includes an admin interface for managing GIF uploads. Payment processing is handled via Stripe. The frontend is developed using React, and the database used is MongoDB.

## Backend (Django)

### Project Setup

The Django backend (`backend`) includes several apps (`accounts`, `chat`, `images`, `mystripe`) and core project settings (`backend`).

- **Setup Instructions:**
  - Clone the repository and navigate to the `backend` directory.
  - Install Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - Set up MongoDB connection in `backend/settings.py`.
  - Apply migrations with `python manage.py migrate`.
  - Start the Django development server with `python manage.py runserver`.

### Apps Overview

- **Accounts (`backend/accounts/`):**
  - Manages user authentication and profile information.
  - Includes models for user management (`models.py`), views (`views.py`), and URLs (`urls.py`).

- **Chat (`backend/chat/`):**
  - Implements WebSocket communication using Django Channels.
  - Includes consumers (`consumers.py`) for handling WebSocket connections, serializers (`serializers.py`), and routing (`routing.py`).

- **Images (`backend/images/`):**
  - Handles storage and management of GIF images.
  - Includes models for image data (`models.py`), serializers (`serializers.py`), and views (`views.py`).

- **Stripe Integration (`backend/mystripe/`):**
  - Integrates Stripe for payment processing.
  - Includes views (`views.py`) for handling payment requests.

## Frontend (React)

### Project Setup

The React frontend (`chat-frontend`) is a single-page application for interacting with the Django backend.

- **Setup Instructions:**
  - Navigate to `chat-frontend` directory.
  - Install Node.js dependencies using `npm install`.
  - Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

### Directory Structure

- **`src/` Directory:**
  - **Components:** Reusable React components (`components/`).
  - **Pages:** Individual React components representing different pages (`pages/`).
  - **Assets:** Static assets such as images, icons (`assets/`).

- **Configuration Files:**
  - `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.
  - `vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite.js bundler.

## Features

- **Chat Functionality:**
  - Real-time communication using WebSocket (Channels).
  - Allows users to send messages and receive instant updates.

- **GIF Management:**
  - Users can purchase GIFs from an admin-uploaded collection.
  - Admin can upload new GIFs via Django admin interface.

- **Payment Processing:**
  - Integration with Stripe for handling payment transactions securely.
  - Users can make purchases to unlock GIF sending capabilities.

## Usage

- **User Authentication:**
  - Users register and log in to access chat and GIF functionalities.
  - Admin users manage GIF uploads and view transaction history via Django admin.

- **Deployment:**
  - Deploy the Django backend and React frontend separately or together using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Docker.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, key features, and usage guidelines for both backend and frontend components. It aims to assist developers in understanding and contributing to the project effectively.
